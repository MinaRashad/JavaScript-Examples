# Javascript Fun Examples

I upload small project made during my work. They are **FUN** to try

currently this repo has

- A solar system simulation that tells your weight on different planets
- A hearing test
- A piano
- playing card generator
- Gradening game

The notable thing is that these projects are all self-contained and do not require internet or extra files
